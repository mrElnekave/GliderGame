# Features:
* All of the terrain you see is randomly generated and infinite. There are also multiple types of worlds (big canyons, smaller hills, etc)
* The glider follows realisitic aerodynamic rules. To calculate the aerodynamic coefficents, we used algorithms in the paper by Khan and Nahon 2015.

# Things to know:
* Esc brings up pause menu
* q/e control yaw, a/d control roll, w/s control pitch
* Otherwise we hope you enjoy and have fun!
